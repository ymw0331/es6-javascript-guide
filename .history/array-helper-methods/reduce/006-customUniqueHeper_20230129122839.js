// Hardmode: Custom 'Unique' Helper
Another really hard one!  Write a function called 'unique' that will remove all the duplicate values from an array.

For example, given the following array:
var numbers = [1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 4];
Your function should return
[1, 2, 3, 4]
Hint: Use the 'reduce' and 'find' helpers.
