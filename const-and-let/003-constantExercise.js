// A Constant Exercise of Letting Variables Be Variables
// Imagine that you are building an application to manage a user's Facebook profile.  A profile might have a 'name', 'age', and 'dateOfBirth'.
// Declare three variables with these same names, making sure to use 'const' or 'let' depending on whether you expect the value to change over time.

const name = "User Name";
let age = 23;
const dateOfBirth = '01/01/1889';
